## ðŸ“š Online Library â€“ CS3240 Final Project

This repository contains my personal copy of the semester-long final project for CS3240: Software Engineering at the University of Virginia. The project centers around building an online library management system that facilitates book lending, user interactions, and administrative oversight.

The application is developed using Python and HTML, structured with Django, and includes modules for book listings, lending workflows, and user authentication. It emphasizes collaborative software development practices, including version control, modular design, and deployment readiness.
